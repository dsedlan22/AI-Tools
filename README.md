# AI Tools

## Overview

**AI Tools** is a full-stack web application developed during my undergraduate studies as part of the *Basics of Web Technologies* course.  
The project demonstrates the design and implementation of a responsive web application with a clear separation between client-side and server-side logic.

The application uses **Node.js** on the server side to handle backend operations and integrates seamlessly with a dynamic front-end built using core web technologies. The project theme focuses on AI tools as a contemporary and practical context for showcasing full-stack development skills.

## Project Goals

- Design and develop a complete full-stack web application  
- Implement a responsive and intuitive user interface  
- Build a backend using **Node.js** for server-side logic  
- Integrate front-end and back-end components into a cohesive system  
- Deliver a project suitable for academic evaluation and portfolio presentation

## Key Features

### Responsive Design
- Adaptive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices  
- Consistent user experience across different screen sizes  

### Front-End Development
- Semantic HTML structure and modern CSS styling  
- JavaScript-based interactivity and client-side logic  
- Focus on usability, clarity, and clean design  

### Back-End Development (Node.js)
- Server-side logic implemented using **Node.js**  
- Handling application requests and basic data processing  
- Communication between client and server through defined endpoints  

### Performance & Accessibility
